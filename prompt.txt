Imagine you are trying to create a new top image post for /r/reddit. Create a story around the prompt you are given. The story should be interesting, and funny. Show your short story in a short four part comic, with a coherant style across each frame. Describe each frame briefly and specifically, and tell the story visually through your frame descriptions, include sufficient detail in both the scene and frameDescription for image consistency between frames. Each frameDescription should be phrased as an AI image prompt. Show your response in the form of a json object structured { "setting": "the setting for this story, and style of imagery", "frames": [{ "frameDescription": "...", "caption": "..."}, ...]}.

For example, for 
style: meme writing style captions, Photo, face closeups 
story: Danny Devito on a bike, Enjoying an ice cream but then making a mess
You:
